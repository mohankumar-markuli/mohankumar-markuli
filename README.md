From Tech to Business Operations & Back: My Journey in Data & Analytics towards Data Platform Engineer
<break>
The past few years have been an incredible learning experience—transitioning from tech engineering to business operations and now returning to my core passion: Data Analytics, AI, and Business Intelligence. After earning my BTech in Computer Science and an MSc in Business Analytics & Big Data (Merit) from the University of Liverpool.

💻 Tech Experience: Systems Engineer | Infosys Ltd. (2020 – 2022)</n>

✅ Designed dashboards & optimized business processes using SQL, Power BI, and Python<br>
✅ Led AI & ML projects, increasing accuracy by 25% and reducing manual effort<br>
✅ Developed chatbot solutions, improving engagement by 40%<br>
✅ Ensured data governance, risk management, and compliance in enterprise environments<br>

⏸ A Year of Hands-On Business Operations (2023-2024) <br> During a personal career break, I worked across multiple industries in the UK, gaining real-world exposure to business processes, supply chains, and customer interactions:🔹 Retail & Warehousing 🔹 Hospitality & Luxury Dining🔹 Parcel & Food Distribution🔹 Sports Clubs & Events 🔹Automobile Quality Inspection (JLR)

💡 I have contributed for more the 30 different business operations across United Kingdom and these experiences have given me practical business knowledge that now enhances my technical problem-solving skills—bridging the gap between technology and real-world operations.

📚 Bridging the Gap: Upskilling & Career Restart
🚀 To ensure a smooth return to Data Science & AI, I have been actively reskilling:

 ✅ Completed: Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp (Udemy)<br>
 ✅ Strengthening SQL, Power BI, Advanced AI/ML with AWS and Statistic skills

Now, I’m excited to return to data-driven decision-making and contribute my technical expertise combined with hands-on business operations knowledge.
